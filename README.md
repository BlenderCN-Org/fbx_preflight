# Blender Preflight

The goal of this project is to script the export of `.blend` files to `.fbx` assets for simpler use in Unity (or other game engines). By taking advantage of the scriptable nature of Blender, we can iterate through a well-structured `.blend` file and automate the tedious process of exporting with the correct settings.
